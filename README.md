# **An analysis of the Stock Market**

## Overview of Project

An analysis of the Stock Market is a project aimed to help our client strategize his investments by providing him with an automated analysis of a portfolio of stocks over a period of time. Utilizing Excel and Visual Basic Applications (VBA), we designed a code to analyze the _total daily volume_ and _yearly return_ for 12 stocks over 2017 and 2018. The result offers the opportunity to carry the analysis in less than two seconds, with a click of a button!
